<PostWrapper>

A lot of time has passed since dotcreators release, and almost from very beginning
we tried to maintain this project and improve it. And now, ready to present an updated
version of site. We have completely rewritten the entire codebase of frontend,
backend and rest of services are coming up as well. In addition, we have moved
out our infrastructure and further support of the project will be a
little easier...

> but not without problems, for example, all tags are gone and now we have to specify them again :0

We have slightly changed way of viewing artists and also updated some components.
Hopefully it will be a little more convenient to use dotcreators now.
We also rewrote the way we get all artists and (hopefully) there will be fewer
moments when our data collection service won't work (like when it didn't work for
almost a full month due to some api issues)

Unfortunately, but for now we removed direct artists suggestion due to
fact that it was affecting stability of data collection a lot, so.... Will try
to figure something out and come back with a ready solution later.

### New features

- Pinned artists. Now your favorite artists will always be at your fingertips,

- And we also added status check of our services, especially our API worker, which does
  all work of data collection

> Thanks to everyone who uses our project and I hope it was at least a little bit useful to you :)
